AI Membership Private Area Theme
=================================

This CiviCRM theme is a fork of the "Blank Theme with Messages for Drupal", which was at the same time a fork of the original "Blank Theme for Drupal" (see: http://drupal.org/project/blank).

It has been modified for being adapted to Amnesty International Spain Private Membership Area Theme.
